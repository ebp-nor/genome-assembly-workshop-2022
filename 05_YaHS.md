# YaHS tutorial

Congratulations, you have created your yeast assembly! But now you have to combine your contigs into scaffolds, and for that we use **YaHS**. YaHS stands for “yet another Hi-C scaffolding tool”, and as the name implies, there are a lot of Hi-C scaffolders out there. However, we in EBP-Nor choose to use YaHS because it is fast, creates more contiguous scaffolds, with better genome statistics compared to other widely used scaffolders.
