# gfastats tutorial

Now itÂ´s time to evaluate the assemblies you have created, starting with **gfastats**. This tool summarises some important assembly metrics such as number of scaffolds and contigs, scaffold and contig N50, and the number of gaps in the assembly. If you want to learn more about gfastats, click [here.](https://github.com/vgl-hub/gfastats) When you are ready, run the code and try to answer the questions below.
