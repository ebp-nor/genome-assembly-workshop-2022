# Merqury tutorial

Another way to validate your assemblies is by using **Merqury**. This k-mer based tool compares k-mers from the unassembled reads to the assemblies you have created, to find the degree of k-mer completeness, i.e. the percentage of the k-mers from the unassembled reads that are found within your assemblies. The advantage of this genome validation tool is that it can be used without any references, which is optimal when assessing de novo assemblies.
