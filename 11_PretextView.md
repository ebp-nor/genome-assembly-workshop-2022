# PretextView tutorial

There are many ways to view a Hi-C contact map, but today we are going to use PretextView. To download the PretextView desktop application, click [here](https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextView/releases), and pick a release that is suitable for your laptop. 

## How to curate manually

 To start the curation process, open the PretextView desktop application, click **load map**, and navigate to where you saved your pretext files. 
 
 When you load your Hi-C contact map, this is what it should look like, depending on which colour scheme you have chosen. For this tutorial we will be using "Blue-Orange Divergent".  
 
 Here, each square represents a scaffold (which after curation will hopefully all be of chromosome length). The red line in the centre shows where the strongest contact signals are between the DNA sequences. 

 Go ahead and look at the extensions for your contact maps. These overlays makes it easier to figure out where the unplaced and wrongly oriented scaffolds are supposed to go. 

 For this tutorial, turn on the **Gaps** extension, and turn the **Gamma Min** and **Gamma Mid** sliders down to zero, and the **Gamma Max** slider all the way up. This will make it easier to see where there are gaps in the assembly, and increase the contrast so the contact signals will be easier to interpret.
