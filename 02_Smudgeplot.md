# Smudgeplot tutorial

The creators of GenomeScope2 created another way to visualize and estimate the ploidy and genome structure, using heterozygous k-mer pairs instead of k-mer frequency distribution. This software, called Smudgeplot, creates a “heatgraph” where a gradient from blue to yellow indicates the relative frequency of k-mer pairs. If the read coverage is good enough, you will have clear “smudges” of yellow which indicates the ploidy of your sequenced organism. The tutorial on how to create a smudgeplot can be found below, but if you want to read more about the software, you can click [here.](https://github.com/KamilSJaron/smudgeplot)
