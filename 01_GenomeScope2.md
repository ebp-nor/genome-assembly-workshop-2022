# GenomeScope2 tutorial

When creating de novo assemblies, there are a lot of considerations to take into account. What is the ploidy of the organism that you are assembling? What is the size of the genome? And what is the heterozygosity rate and repeat content? All these parameters, and more, can be determined by running GenomeScope2. For this tutorial we will be running the code below, but for more information about the software, you can click [*here*.](https://github.com/tbenavi1/genomescope2.0)
